# Kickbot JS (aka Kickbot V2)
## Description
My second Discord bot, written in JavaScript this time around. I revisited my first bot 2 years after my last commit, and there seem to be significant changes underway with its Python library.  So since I've been learning JS I thought it would be fun to start from scratch with this.

## Features
Coming soon.
